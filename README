Matemat
=======

The Matemat is a vending machine for carbonated soft drinks.
Its hardware and software were designed by members of the
(Chaostreff Basel)[1] and released in the form of circuit
diagrams, printed circuit board layouts and source code
for anyone to use and modify.

Under certain restrictions, even commercial exploitation is
permissible. Please see the accompanying LICENSE file for
details.

The name "Matemat" is a portmanteau of "mate" (as in mate
tea) and "automat" (as in the German word for vending
machine). It was devised specifically to dispense mate tea
based soft drinks, but may be used for other types of
beverages as well.

For the first Matemat prototype to be bult, an old vending
machine with built in refrigerator was repurposed.

The software source code can be (downloaded separately)[2].
