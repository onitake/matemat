Matemat
=======

The Matemat is a vending machine for carbonated soft drinks.
All hardware and software was designed by members of
(Chaostreff Basel)[1] and released in the form of circuit
diagrams, printed circuit board layouts and source code
for anyone to use and modify.

Under certain restrictions, even commercial exploitation is
permissible. Please see the accompanying LICENSE file for
details.

The name "Matemat" is a portmanteau of "mate" (as in mate
tea) and "automat" (the German word for vending machine).

The device is mainly intended to dispense mate tea based
soft drinks, but may be used for other types of beverages
too.

To build the first prototype, an old vending machine with
a cooled bottle compartment was repurposed.

The software source code can be (downloaded separately)[2].
